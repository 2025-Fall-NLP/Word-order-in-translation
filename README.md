# Word-order-in-translation
This repo is for SNU 2025 Fall NLP term project.

## Introduction

It is generally accepted that word order similarity affects translation quality. However, it is hard to find studies that look closely at the exact relationship between word order similarity and translation performance. In this study, we plan to define a measure of word order similarity between two languages and check the machine translation quality for different language pairs to see if higher similarity really leads to better translation. 


Plus, we plan to find various methods such as data preprocessing and prompt engineering to improve the quality of low-performance language pairs.

## Main Tasks

* Quantitative representation of word order similarity and exploration of its relationship with translation quality
    * (Optional) Analysis of cases where languages have similar word order but show large differences in translation quality

* Seeking improvement methods for language pairs with low translation performance
